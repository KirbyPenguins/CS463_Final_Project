Hello, this is the read me file for my final CS463 project.
The outline is simple and if ytou were to run it in github 
paged you would be able to tell that index.html is the welcom/first page
So you may start by running the live server on index.html and go from
there. You should be able to scroll where ever you would like. All of the
names of my files (besides index.html) correspond with my pages.

All of my photos and files that are needed in order to run all of my 
websites are in my FIles folder and include my hw section, my resume, and 
my images. 

If you would like to see my thinking the journal.txt keeps track of everything 
that I have been working on.

There is not additional libraries that I have added and if you would like a link to 
my github pages it is. https://kirbypenguins.github.io/CS463_Final_Project/projects.html 

In order to see my form submission .js and my script.js (this script handles the buttons)
please right click the page select inspect and then go to console and from there it will show
the form submission and the button press. There is also two download links present one that will
download my resume and the other that will download my analysis report. I get a wave warning about
one of my Resume download link, however it just says make sure that people understand that this is
actually a download link. Since I clearly state that it is I think that I do not have to fix this
warning.
