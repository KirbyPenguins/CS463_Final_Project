          <p> This is just some of the things that I have worked on throughout
            my time at Portland State University. There are three
            projects that I will showcase on this webpage. The first project is one that
            I learned in my programming language class. It was a project where I created my own language.
            I started with a simple interpreter that handles an image class and can combine/rotate images,
            and then I expanded it to handle multiple operations.

              In CS358 I developed a simple interpreter that handles an image class and can combine/rotate images.
              I then expanded the interpreter to handle multiple operations. Below is a link of my repository,
              so you can try it out yourself.The first image and the second image are the before and the third
              image is after. There are also a couple other commands that I didnt add. The image above is only a demonstration of what it can do. 
              I have also included a link to my public repo, feel free to fork it and check it out for yourself.

              In CS463 Homework, we were tasked with four assignments. The first assignment was an
              accessibility assignment, we were given a website and we were supposed to fix all of
              the errors. We were also tasked with creating a form that would take in user input.

                In addition to my coursework, I have also worked on personal projects to further enhance my skills.
                One such project is a personal website that I built from scratch to showcase my portfolio and blog.
                Below is a screenshot of the website.
