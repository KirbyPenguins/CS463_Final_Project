          <p> This is just some of the things that I have worked on throughout
            my time at Portland State University. There are three
            projects that I will showcase on this webpage. The first project is one that
            I learned in my programming language class. It was a project where I created my own language.
            I started with a simple interpreter that handles an image class and can combine/rotate images,
            and then I expanded it to handle multiple operations.

              In CS358 I developed a simple interpreter that handles an image class and can combine/rotate images.
              I then expanded the interpreter to handle multiple operations. Below is a link of my repository,
              so you can try it out yourself.The first image and the second image are the before and the third
              image is after. There are also a couple other commands that I didnt add. The image above is only a demonstration of what it can do. 
              I have also included a link to my public repo, feel free to fork it and check it out for yourself. Please feel free to contact me to
              ask any questions.

              In CS463 Homework, we were tasked with four assignments. The first assignment was an
              accessibility assignment, we were given a website and we were supposed to fix all of
              the errors. We were also tasked with creating a form that would take in user input.
              The next assignment was learning about cards, schedules, and forms. This was a good 
              way to learn about css and how to select elements and actually utilize css. The

              In adition to my course work I have also created an analysis report. This report is about
              RUST and what Rust is. The analysis report goes in depth about what Rust is, how it was made
              and what it is used for. The report also mentions how to actually use the language. What are the 
              benefits and the downsides. The report also goes into detail about the syntax and how to actually
              write code in Rust. Below is a download link to the report. Please feel free to download it and
              read it.
