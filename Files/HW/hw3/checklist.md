## Checklist

Prior to turning in your assignment, complete the following checklist in regards to the code checks and the CSS code.

#### Accessibility Code Check

- [x] Use the Wave AIM browser extension to run an accessibility audit on your completed solutions.

#### Valid Code Check

- [x] Check that your HTML code is valid using the w3c validator.
- It is important to note that when I ran it through a validator
  I found that there were two errors that I could not find. The
  area that said there was an error there was not actually any 
  errors.
- [x] Check that your CSS code is valid using the w3c validator.

#### CSS Specific Code
- I also did not use any css when coding with java script and 
  I primarily handled everything with bootstrap. 

- [x] The CSS code should primarily use classes to assign styles to elements.
- [x] Make sure to use the custom properties specified in the styles.css file.
- [x] Use ES6+ for your JavaScript code.
- [x] Have your JavaScript code inside of functions.
- [x] Review the code submitted against the [CSS code style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css#css), which outlines how CSS code should be written.
