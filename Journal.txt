Week #1

    In this week I figured I would brainstorm and figure out what I think I would 
    like and so forth. I finally ended up on doing multiple html files for multiple 
    pages. I think that this would be the best approach since I can decide if I want
    to use CSS or Java on other pages to show how much I have learned in this class. 
    I also added a nav bar. I used the bootstrap navbar that I learned from the previous
    assignment. I also figured out how to deploy to github pages which was actually a little
    difficult becuase of the pupline and trying to figure that out. I ended up using a youtube
    video that I found online to get more help with figuring it out.


Week #2

    Wednesday:
    In this week I am almost finished with form which is the welcome page that
    talks about me and what I do and other stuff like that. For the new thing 
    that I am going to implement I think I will add a download link to be able to
    download my resume or my ohter mieces of work. I think that I am doing good and
    making steady progress I am going to work a lot over the weekend. I have been using
    Google a lot to help me out with the CSS and so forth. 

    Thursday:

    the website that helped me learning about my download link. 


Week #3 

    Friday: I started on my prjoects page. I feel like this is where the bulk of my
    information will be. I started with my CS358 project which was a simple language 
    interp. I think I really like how it turned out. It has a couple of images of what 
    a potential final project could be, and it also has the link to the repository so
    if you wanted to fork it and try it out for yourself. I found google really helpful 
    in telling me about the image carosel. I think it was perfect for this section.
