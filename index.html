                  student at Portland State University. I am
                  excited to show you what I have learned. This is a collection of my projects that I have

          <div class="container">
              <p id="main_text" class="right_padding"> I was born in Whitehorse, Canada and moved when I was a little 
                kid to Yakutat, Alaska. I then moved from Yakutat to Haines when I was in 6th grade.
                I have always grown up in a small town and I have always loved the outdoors, which is why
                I love Portland even though Portland is not so much a small town. I am a huge fan of hiking, camping, 
                and fishing. The reason why I chose Computer science because I have always been 
                intrested in how computer works and how they can be used to solve
                problems. I first decided to play basketball in Missouri and a half a year in the phillippines
                before I decied to go to Portland state and have been here ever since.
